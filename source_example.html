While true in theory, code that relies on destructors to clean up unmanaged resources does not port cleanly to GC as-is in practice. GC of course has its own drawbacks. Heap scanning is expensive, thrashing cache and burning battery. GCs also require higher memory ceiling proportional to the amount of heap actively being used, and GCs suitable for interactive use tend to increase responsiveness at the cost of higher memory use, which has its own second-order energy costs—devices need more RAM, and spend more time swapping or killing, and thus need bigger batteries to refresh all that RAM. ARC interoperates better with unmanaged resources, both non-memory resources like sockets and files and also C-level memory resources. The ARC optimizer and Swift's calling convention also optimize toward reclaiming resources closer to their last use, keeping resource usage low.
